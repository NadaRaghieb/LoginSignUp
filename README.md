# LoginSignUp
I create Login and Sign Up page by React js
I created a login and registration page using the React library.
I created a components folder and inside it, I created a single file that contains the code for the login and registration page.
To make them separate pages on the website, I used JavaScript conditions.
If the login button is clicked, the login page appears, which includes fields for email, password, and forgot password.
If the registration button is clicked, the registration page appears, which includes fields for name, email, and password, and the forgot password option disappears.
